    "A Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) is a probabilistic model $p(\\bx, \\bz)$ over observed variables $\\bx$ and latent variables and/or parameters $\\bz$. Here we distinguish the decoder part, $p(\\bx | \\bz) p(\\bz)$ and an encoder part, that are both specified with a neural network. A lower bound on the log marginal likelihood $\\log p(\\bx)$ can be obtained by approximately inferring the latent variables z from the observed data x using an encoder distribution $q(\\bz| \\bx)$ that is also specified as a neural network. This lower bound is then optimized to fit the model to the data. \n",
